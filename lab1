B0 = 2;   I have tried to make this lab relevant to some of the things you will encounter on exams.
B1 = 3;   here we are going to give the system an 8-bit signal we will call A. we are going to use  
B2 = 4;   this signal to manipulate an "output signal" that will write to an output variable B, which 
B3 = 5;   has 8 bits. The numbers on the right side of the = sign are the pins that connect to outputs 
B4 = 6;   B0-B7. You will notice that this section is commented out. This is because there is a better 
B5 = 7;   and more efficient way to connect these pins to this variable that we have created.

     For example: int x = Serial.parseInt(); 

     Here, if the user inputs 75 to the serial monitor, then calling Serial.parseInt()
     will assign value 75 to variable x. 

     While this may seem trivial, what is actually happening is that the input provided
     to the serial monitor is a string (i.e., a sequence of characters), which must be

  /*  
    The bottom of loop() is where the fun begins. You have now provided the system with 
    an input (a signal) and you have specified a bit that you would like view, so that 
    you can determine whether its value is 0 or 1. This is similar to how RIMS input A 
    and output B work on in-class exercises and exams.
    
    For this assignment, you will need to use masking and bit manipulation (see zyBook 
    Sections 2.4-2.7) to identify and extract the desired bit and to transform
    it into a usable value. 

    We provide the following suggestions to help you with this exercise:
    - Create one or more helper functions to keep your code clean and modular
    - Use the Arduino delay() function to mimic the demo video
      NOTE: Using the delay() function in later labs will create significant problems.     
            Please do not call this function unless directed to do so. 
      WARNING: Starting with Laboratory Assignment #2, we will impose significant grading 
               penalties if you write arbitrary code that calls delay()
      WARNING: Quizzes and exams are based on RIMS, not the Arduino API.
